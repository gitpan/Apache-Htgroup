	* Makefile.PL (1.5): Oops. Typo in Makefile.PL

2002-01-27 11:07  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.4): 'make docs' makes the README and the
	ChangeLog. Need to have a CVS checkout for this to work, but it
	will make sure that the right docs go in the tarball.

2002-01-27 11:06  rbowen

	* README (1.10): Removed README from CVS, since it is autogenerated
	on 'make docs' Still in the MANIFEST, as we want it in the distro.

2002-01-27 11:04  rbowen

	* lib/Apache/Htgroup.pm (1.22, Apache-Htgroup-1_22): Added the

	the module itself.

2002-01-27 10:56  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.6, Apache-Htgroup-1_22): Added ChangeLog to the

	* lib/Apache/Htgroup.pm (1.17): Patch from Ben Tilly in order to
	compensate for the fact that Apache does not like group lists that
	run over 8k, but is ok with breaking a group listing over several
	lines. Long lines are split over several lines.

2001-07-11 22:19  rbowen
