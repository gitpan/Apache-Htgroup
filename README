NAME
    Apache::Htgroup - Manage Apache authentication group files

SYNOPSIS
      use Apache::Htgroup;
      $group = new Apache::Htgroup ($path_to_groupfile);
      $foo = $group->isMember($username);
      $group->addUser($username);
      $group->deleteUser($username);

DESCRIPTION
    Manage Apache htgroup files

    new  $group = new Apache::Htgroup ($path_to_groupfile);

         Creates a new object of the Apache::Htgroup class

    isMember
                 $foo = $group->isMember($username);

         Returns true if the username is in the group, false
         otherwise

    addUser
                 $group->addUser($username);

         Adds the user to the group.

    deleteUser
                 $group->deleteUser($username);

         Removes the specified user from the group.

    groups
                 $groups = $group->groups;

         Returns a reference to a hash of the groups. The key is the
         name of the group, and the value is a string containing all
         the users separated by spaces - exactly as it appears in
         the group file.

    writeFile
                 $group->writeFile($groups);

         Writes out the group file. $groups is a hashref that looks
         like the hash returned by the `groups' method.

Bugs/To do/Disclaimer
    I wrote this in a real hurry. I knew that it would save time in
    the long run if I wrote this as a module, but I did not have the
    time to put in all the doodads that really belong in here.

    I really need to have some file locking here, but this is a rush
    job. I'll add this some time soon.

    Need to have reasonable return values on failure. I'll add this
    when I'm in less of a hurry.

    Need to add some reasonable tests in test.pl. Same excuse.

    Patches and suggestions welcome.
